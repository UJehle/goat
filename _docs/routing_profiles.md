As GOAT is designed for active mobility, roads that are only designed for cars (e.g. highways) are excluded per default from the routing network.
In addition, this can be adjusted when setting up the application. Depending on the data precision in the study area and the purpose of the GOAT version, different routing profiles are available.

When setting up your own GOAT version, the available routing profiles and according default speeds can be adjusted in configuration files. However, the speed can be adjusted directly in the user interface.

#### Walking
<b>Standard<b>

Default routing profile for walking, considering all path accessible by foot.

Default walking speed: 5km/h

<b>Elderly<b>

Same as the standard routing profile, but with a reduced walking speed of 3 km/h. 

<b>Safe-night<b>

The safe-routing excludes all non-illuminated paths. The idea behind this routing profile is to model changes in accessibility over time. Some paths, for example through green areas, are pretty attractive during the day, but as soon as the sun goes down and these paths are not illuminated, they become unattractive to many users. With this safe-night routing option, deficiencies in the illuminated path-network can be found and paths that have an important connection function but are not illuminated can be identified.

As there are two options to map the illuminance in OSM (by mapping the street lamps or by assigning the tag "lit" to the road sequence) both have to be considered in order to classify which road segments are illuminated and which are not. First, the way attributes are checked. Since the tag "lit" is not always specified, but the information of the other tags allows conclusions about the street lighting, the paths are classified according to the following scheme:

This scheme was designed on the basis of common patterns in the OSM-data in Germany. As these may be different in other countries, all those conditions can be adjusted in the configuration files of GOAT.

After checking the way attributes, a 15m-buffer was created around all mapped street lamps. All streets that intersect with the streetlamp buffer and did not have the tag "lit" assigned, are also classified as lit.

Via the layer "Illuminance" (to be found in the Street Level Quality layers), the lighting conditions of the paths can be displayed. 

This routing profile is only enabled for study areas with very good data on illuminance. 


#### Cycling
<b>Standard<b>

Default routing profile for cycling, considering all paths accessible by bicycle. 

Default cycling speed: 15km/h

Depending on the surface, smoothness and slope of the different street segments, the cycling speed is adjusted accordingly. 

<b>Pedelec<b>

Same as the standard routing profile, but with an increased cycling speed of 23 km/h. 

For Pedelecs, slopes are considered with a lower impedance than for Standard bicycles. 

#### Wheelchair

The wheelchair-routing is based on the walking routing, but considers only barrier-free paths and destinations. Stairs, unpaved paths and paths with high slopes are excluded from the routing. POIs that are not barrier-free are visualised with grey icons and are regarded as not accessible if the wheelchair routing profile is selected. 

Via the layer "Wheelchair Usability" (to be found in the Street Level Quality layers), the conditions regarding the freedom from barriers of the paths can be displayed. 

This routing profile helps to find shortcoming in the barrier-free network of a city. The importance of barrier-free infrastructure gets increasingly important when considering demographic change in many societies. In addition, a high percentage of the population is temporarily mobility impaired (e.g. by pushing a baby carriage or carrying heavy luggage). All these people and needs must be taken into account when planning infrastructure for active mobility.
